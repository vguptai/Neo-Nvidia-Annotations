# Neo-Nvidia-Annotations
 
## Overview
 
This repository contains the tightly annotated Neo-Nvidia annotations contributed in the paper "[Progression Modelling for Online and Early Gesture Detection]" by Vikram Gupta, Sai Kumar Dwivedi, Rishabh Dabral and Arjun Jain. The paper has been accepted for oral presentation at the International Conference on 3D Vision, Quebec City, Canada, 2019.
 
In this paper, we propose a multi-task framework for online and early gesture recognition which is crucial for building touchless gesture bases interfaces. In the online settings, our approach recognises the gestures at an early stage with high precision and also achieves state-of-the-art results on the NVIDIA gesture dataset in the offline settings. We also evaluated our approach on the Montalbano dataset and report competitive results.
